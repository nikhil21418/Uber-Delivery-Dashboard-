# Uber Service Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository contains the Power BI project file and description for an interactive dashboard analyzing Uber service data. The goal was to visualize key metrics related to ride activity, potentially including driver patterns, popular times/locations, and operational trends.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Microsoft Power BI:**
    * Power Query: For data cleaning and preparation.
    * Power BI Desktop: For dashboard development and visualization.
* **Data Source:** [Mention the source or type of data used, e.g., Public Uber dataset, Simulated data]

## 📈 Dashboard Features & Analysis

The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, aiming to answer questions like:

* What are the peak hours/days for Uber rides?
* Which locations have the highest ride demand or supply?
* How do ride durations or distances vary?
* [Add any other specific metrics you analyzed]

*(**Important:** Add screenshots of your Power BI dashboard visuals here!)*
